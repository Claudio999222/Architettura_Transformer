# Transformer Architecture for Training

## Overview

In this notebook, we explore and implement the Transformer architecture for training a machine learning model. The Transformer architecture, introduced in the paper "Attention Is All You Need" by Vaswani et al., has become a cornerstone in natural language processing and sequence-to-sequence tasks.

## Key Components and Concepts Covered:

1. **Self-Attention Mechanism**: Understand the self-attention mechanism, a crucial component of the Transformer architecture that allows the model to weigh input tokens differently.

2. **Multi-Head Attention**: Explore multi-head attention, which involves running the self-attention mechanism multiple times in parallel and concatenating the results.

3. **Positional Encoding**: Learn about positional encoding, a technique used to inject information about the positions of tokens into the model, overcoming the lack of inherent sequential information in self-attention.

4. **Feedforward Networks**: Examine the feedforward network within the Transformer layers.

5. **Layer Normalization and Residual Connections**: Understand the role of layer normalization and residual connections in stabilizing training.

6. **Encoder and Decoder Architectures**: Implement both the encoder and decoder architectures of the Transformer.

7. **Masking for Sequence-to-Sequence Tasks**: Explore the use of masking in the decoder to prevent attending to future tokens during training.

8. **Position-wise Feedforward Networks**: Delve into the specifics of position-wise feedforward networks within the Transformer.

## Why Transformer Matters:

- **Parallelization**: Transformer allows for efficient parallelization of training, making it well-suited for handling long sequences.

- **Capturing Long-Range Dependencies**: The self-attention mechanism enables the model to capture long-range dependencies in input sequences effectively.

- **State-of-the-Art Performance**: Transformer architectures have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various natural language processing tasks.

By the end of this notebook, you'll have a solid understanding of the Transformer architecture and how to implement it for training a machine learning model on sequence-to-sequence tasks.
